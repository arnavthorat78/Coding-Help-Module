# Contributing

First of all, _thanks_ for contributing with this project! Your cooperation will make this module _better_!

## What Should I Know?

You should know some JavaScript (including methods, and more) to be able to contribute. You should also know about Node.js and NPM.

## Don't Want to Code?

If you don't want to participate in the coding of the module, that's fine! What you can do instead is teat out the methods released in each version.

If there are any possible fixes for this, you can tell me on the [Issues](https://github.com/arnavthorat78/Coding-Help-Module/issues) page!

## Contact Me!

## Again, Thanks!

Thanks so much for thinking of contributing!
