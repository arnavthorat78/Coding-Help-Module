This module is very useful for getting help with features that JavaScript doesn't provide!

## By the way...

See my Google Home website at [this link](https://arnavthorat78.github.io/Google-Home/)!

## Installation

To install, simply run the following command.

```
$ npm install coding-help
```

To use this in your project, you can simply use `require`.

```js
const codingHelp = require("coding-help");
```

## Not much yet!

There isn't much to display yet. There is the only the `version` variable intended for testing, which will be removed in _v1.0.5_.

But soon, more will come!
