This module is very useful for getting help with features that JavaScript doesn't provide!

## By the way...

See my Google Home website at [this link](https://arnavthorat78.github.io/Google-Home/)!

## Installation

To install, simply run the following command.

```
$ npm install coding-help
```

To use this in your project, you can simply use `require`.

```js
const codingHelp = require("coding-help");
```

## Math

The `math` part of the Coding Help module is very helpful for doing mathematics activities!

### Table

See the table below to look for the commands in the `math` section.

| Command            | Description                                                                                                          |

| `E`                | The mathematical constant E. This is Euler's number, the base of natural logarithms.                                 |
| `add`              | Add multiple numbers together.                                                                                       |

| `divide`           | Divide multiple numbers in the order passed in.                                                                      |
| `power`            | Get the power of multiple numbers together.                                                                          |
| `randNum`          | Get a random number from a minimum number to a maximum number.                                                       |
| `getMaxNum`        | Get the maximum number from a list of numbers.                                                                       |
| `getMinNum`        | Get the minimum number from a list of numbers. _This number is dependent on `getMaxNum`!_                            |
| `avg`              | Get the average number from a list of numbers.                                                                       |
| `compassToDegrees` | Convert a compass heading (e.g. S), and convert it to degrees. **Set to be moved!**                                  |
| `removeDecimal`    | Remove the decimal from a number. This is helpful if you want to convert a float to an integer. **Set to be moved!** |

## Booleans

The `boolean` part is helpful for boolean tasks. Right now, there isn't much, but soon, more will come!

### Table

See the table below to look for commands in `booleans`.

| Command      | Description                                                           |

## Documentation

Right now, unfortunately, there is no documentation for this module.

But, if there are many total downloads, a documentation website may come out!

## More coming soon!

Soon, we are going to provide more functionality with `strings`, `numbers`, and much more, to make your code easier to read and quicker to write!
